India’s 1991 Reforms: A Retrospective Overview
Montek Singh Ahluwalia1
Much has been achieved in the twenty-five years since the reforms began but as the old problems were solved, new ones have surfaced and solving these needs new initiatives that will have to be as far-reaching as the original reforms were.
In one sense, economic reforms are a continuing process, because policies are regularly modified to improve performance or respond to new challenges. But every now and then, we witness a paradigm shift in the way the economy is managed. The 1991 reforms in India are special because they represent precisely such a shift.
The need for policy changes had become evident by the end of the 1970s, when it was clear that India was lagging behind other East Asian and South East Asian countries. Analysts, both inside and outside government, argued persuasively that India’s poor performance was due to the stifling controls over private-sector activity and the insulation of the economy from global competition because of import controls, high tariffs and a generally negative approach towards foreign investment. These controls began to be moderated in the 1980s, at first in a limited way under Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in the first half of the decade and then more aggressively in the second half under Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. These changes had a favourable impact on growth performance, raising the average growth rate of GDP to 5.6 per cent in the 1980s, as opposed to only 2.9 per cent in the 1970s. However, the policy changes, though important, were not systemic. They introduced flexibility at the margin but left the control system itself in place, liable to reversal at any time.
By the end of the 1980s, it was clear that a more fundamental change was needed and the reforms of 1991 signalled the start of this change. A quarter century later, it is necessary to look back and see what worked and what didn’t. This paper presents a retrospective assessment using two somewhat different approaches. Section I focuses on the design of the reforms, whether it was appropriate, and how it was implemented in practice. Section II focuses on the outcomes. Did the reforms succeed in their stated objectives in terms of growth and other goals?
I. Issues Related to the Content of the Reforms
The 1991 reforms were introduced in the context of a severe balance-of-payments crisis and, as such, consisted of two components. One was a conventional macroeconomic consolidation package aimed at reducing the fiscal deficit to lower aggregate excess demand, which had spilled over into the balance of payments. The other component was a package of structural reforms, designed to raise productivity and make the economy more competitive, laying the foundations for more rapid growth.
It is the structural reform component that signalled a paradigm shift in the way the economy was to be managed. The earlier suspicion of the private sector—and of markets in general—gave way to a new emphasis on freeing the creative energies of the private sector by allowing it to respond to market forces. It was explicitly stated that the domestic industry had been excessively protected for too long through high tariffs and import controls, making it inefficient and uncompetitive. The new strategy signalled a reduction in the level of protection and a shift to a much more open economy, in which self-reliance meant exports paying for imports with a modest requirement for external capital flows. In addition, it was proposed that historical fears of foreign direct investment—the ghost of the East India Company—be laid to rest and foreign investment be welcomed as an instrument for modernizing Indian industry. The public sector had traditionally been viewed as occupying the commanding heights of the economy. There was no invocation of privatization rejecting the public sector on ideological grounds, but it was clearly asserted that the public sector was expected to perform efficiently, or shut down if it couldn’t stop making losses.
Several questions arise about the design of the reforms and how they were implemented. Were the 1991 reforms comprehensive enough to cover a sufficient range of areas, and were they appropriately sequenced? Were they thrust upon a reluctant government solely under pressure from the IMF and the World Bank? Was the pace of implementation too slow? Were they incomplete in the sense of not being followed up by a second generation of reforms and, if so, what should these reforms have attempted? My answers to these questions are summarized below.
Was the 1991 Package Sufficiently Comprehensive and Well Sequenced?
The reform package was clearly much more comprehensive than anything attempted earlier. Its comprehensiveness can be seen from the following ten most important changes mentioned in the Budget speech.
(i) Industrial licensing was abolished for all but a handful of industries where it was retained for either strategic reasons or because of environmental sensitivity.
(ii) Abolition of licensing also meant that the location of industries was no longer decided by the government as part of the licensing approval but by the entrepreneur, subject to local government approvals.
(iii) The list of industries earlier reserved for the public sector was drastically reduced from eighteen to eight.
(iv) Control over investment by the so-called ‘large houses’ covered by the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Act, intended to discourage the concentration of wealth, was abolished.
(v) FDI, which was earlier allowed only up to 40 per cent of total equity, and that too subject to discretion, was freely allowed up to 51 per cent of total equity in a large range of industries. In addition, a Foreign Investment Promotion Board was set up to actively pursue FDI.
(vi) Industries were allowed to freely enter into agreements for technology transfer as long as the royalty payments were within stipulated levels as a percentage of turnover.
(vii) There was major liberalization of foreign trade, with import controls abolished for intermediate goods, capital goods and components, all of which could be freely imported against tradeable import entitlement licences (called exim scrips) issued to exporters at 30 per cent of export value (40 per cent in some cases).2
(viii) A new policy was articulated towards public-sector enterprises, under which loss-making PSUs deemed non-revivable would be closed down.
(ix) A phased programme of tax reform covering direct and indirect taxes was to be undertaken based on the recommendations of the Chelliah Committee.
(x) A programme of financial-sector reforms was to be undertaken based on the recommendations of the Narasimham Committee.
The first six items listed above were implemented in the very first year. In the case of trade policy (item vii), the exim scrip arrangement introduced in July 1991 was quickly replaced by a dual exchange rate on 1 March 1992, which, in turn, was replaced by a unified market-determined exchange rate on 2 March 1992. In the short space of two years, investment controls on the private sector were more or less abolished, and the rigid import-licensing system was also dismantled, and all items of capital goods, components, intermediates and raw materials were made freely importable. The fact that decontrol of investment occurred simultaneously with trade liberalization was an important act of sequencing, since otherwise, the industrial decontrol would have been negated by the need to get import licences.
The liberalization of trade policy simultaneously with an initial devaluation, followed by a shift to a flexible exchange rate, was another example of sensible sequencing. The exchange rate was very significantly depreciated over a two-year period, and this made it possible to liberalize import controls and reduce import duties with far fewer problems than would have arisen if trade liberalization was not accompanied by exchange-rate depreciation.
The exclusion of finished consumer goods, such as garments, processed foods, household appliances, consumer electricals, scooters and cars, from the initial stages of liberalization was also a conscious sequencing decision, since most of these items were produced by a large range of smaller and middle-sized industries and would have needed more time to face competition. However, as we argue later, the liberalization of this segment was unnecessarily delayed.
An important feature of the 1991 reforms is that the extent of the change in policy, which was very considerable, was deliberately underplayed for political reasons. Jairam Ramesh (2016) reported that when the proposed changes in industrial policy were presented to the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, there was a strong negative reaction from senior Congress party politicians, who saw it as a reversal of traditional Congress policies. However, the same proposals were found acceptable later when presented along with a preamble that acknowledged the contributions of earlier Congress prime ministers, outlining the changes as a continuation of a long-established tradition of modifying policies in the face of new challenges. Instead of a forthright declaration that fundamental change was needed, it was found more practical to emphasize continuity to avoid dissension within the party. This is an example of political considerations leading to a conscious choice of ‘reform by stealth’. While it had some advantages in the short term, it is evident that it also had long-term disadvantages, since it kept the political class locked into older slogans.
Were the Reforms Home-grown?
The reforms were severely criticized by opposition parties and the large community of left-leaning academics opposed to liberalization, on the grounds that they were thrust upon a reluctant but helpless government by the IMF and the World Bank as the price for providing financial assistance. Since issues of sovereignty often cloud debates on public policy, it is worth putting the record straight on this issue.
There is no doubt that the new government, which took office on 21 June 1991, faced a desperate situation. Foreign-exchange reserves were down to $1.1 billion—roughly within two weeks of imports—and a fear of default was in the air. Support from the IMF and the World Bank was absolutely necessary, and it would not have come without conditionality. It is also true that the reforms announced in 1991, including both the reduction in the fiscal deficit and the structural reforms in industrial, trade and public-sector policy, were incorporated in the agreement with the IMF/World Bank financing. However, it would be wrong to believe that the reforms were thrust upon an unwilling government. I have outlined in some detail the build-up of the internal thinking in the years preceding the reforms, and it is clear that many of the steps taken in 1991 had been discussed internally and had supporters within the government.3
It is fair to say that the crisis became the occasion for the reformers within government to push for what they had been talking about. I have no doubt that in the absence of a crisis, these changes might not have been made so quickly. It is to the credit of the Narasimha Rao–Manmohan Singh duo that they did not ‘waste the crisis’. In an article I wrote for the Economic and Political Weekly (2016), I mention four reasons why one can argue that there was internal commitment to the reforms, independent of pressure from the international financial institutions. First, in some areas, notably trade liberalization and the shift to a market-determined exchange rate, the reform package went well beyond what the IMF and World Bank were advocating. Second, the reforms consciously excluded any commitment to privatization, which was a part of the then prevalent ‘Washington Consensus’, but would not have been acceptable politically. Third, the balance-of-payments crisis was over by the end of 1993, and if IMF pressure was the only factor pushing the reforms, the process would have ended in 1993. On the contrary, reforms continued subsequently, though admittedly at a slower pace. Finally, despite the opposition to the reforms when they were introduced, the political process worked in such a way that the reforms were continued by the succeeding United Front Government, and was carried on by the Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led NDA government that followed. In other words, even as there was considerable political posturing and criticism of the reforms when they were first announced, there was a working consensus of sorts, which extended beyond the Congress party and made it possible for the reforms to be carried forward by subsequent governments.
Was the Pace of Implementation Too Slow?
It is a fair criticism of the reforms that implementation was very slow. The original reform strategy did envisage gradual implementation and not a ‘big bang’ approach. While industrial controls were lifted in a big-bang manner, the trade reforms, the reform of the exchange-rate system, and the reduction in import duties took place more gradually. Similarly, financial-sector reforms and tax reforms were also expected to be rolled out in a phased manner. However, it would be fair to say that the actual implementation was significantly slower than gradualism alone would justify.
As noted above, the first two or three years saw a fairly impressive pace of implementation in the area of industrial decontrol, trade liberalization and the shift to a market-determined exchange rate, as well as the start of a process of duty reduction. Some elements that were not in the original list of reforms were implemented quickly as well. For example, the liberalization of FDI inflows was accompanied by a parallel liberalization of inflows from Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) towards the end of 1992, allowing them to invest in shares and bonds through stock exchanges. This window ensured a substantial inflow of funds in subsequent years.
At the same time, there were long delays in implementing many elements compared with targets announced. For example, P. Chidambaram, as the finance minister of the United Front government, lowered the peak rate of duty to 40 per cent and the capital goods duty to 20 per cent in 1997–98, and also stated that further reductions were needed, implying that our import duties would be lowered to ASEAN levels in three years, i.e., by 2000. Unfortunately, the NDA government, under Atal Bihari Vajpayee, did not follow through on this component of the reforms, nor did the Congress-led UPA government, which took office in 2004, pick up the thread. The present position is that sixteen years after the target date was announced in 1997–98, our duty rates are still higher on average than of ASEAN countries though the difference has narrowed.
The retention of quantitative restrictions on consumer goods is another area where policy action was inordinately delayed. The logic that competition from imports would help achieve cost efficiency and improve product quality applied just as forcefully to the consumer-goods sector as to others. As noted above, the initial decision to leave consumer goods out of import liberalization was a tactical decision to avoid wide-ranging protests at the start of the liberalization process, but imports of consumer goods should have been liberalized a few years later. However, it actually happened only in 2002, following a World Trade Organization (WTO) ruling against India on a case brought by the United States Trade Representative, arguing that quantitative restrictions on imports were only allowable on balance-of-payments grounds, and there was no sign of balance-of-payments stress in India. A voluntary liberalization of consumer goods, without the compulsion of a WTO ruling, would have provided an opportunity to explain the rationale of the move to the domestic industry, which could have been given WTO-compatible protection through tariffs, with the tariff level declining steadily over time.
Implementation of public-sector reform also fell far short of intention. It was clearly stated when the reforms were unveiled that the public sector must achieve higher levels of efficiency and must be given autonomy of decision-making, but units that continued to make losses would be closed down. This was not done for fear of a backlash from the labour unions, which were well represented in all the political parties. Subsequently, sale of equity to a strategic partner with management control was envisaged for some units, and one or two decisions to implement this policy were taken, but became controversial. A fresh attempt is now being made, based on recommendations made by the NITI Aayog, the successor institution to the former Planning Commission, to sell some public-sector units along with management control and to close down others. It remains to be seen how effectively this will be implemented
Opening the insurance sector to private participants is another example of slow implementation. The Insurance Act made insurance a government monopoly and the need to introduce competition was recognized as a legitimate objective. The finance ministry appointed the R.N. Malhotra Committee to make recommendations in this area, and the committee recommended that an insurance regulatory authority be established to spell out the regulatory structure under which all insurers would work, after which private-sector insurers could be allowed to enter with foreign partners holding a minority stake. A statutory authority was put in place in 1999 by the NDA government of Atal Bihari Vajpayee. However, when the Insurance Act had to be amended to allow private sector entry into insurance, differences arose on the extent of foreign equity that foreign partners could hold, and it was finally limited to 26 per cent. This was widely regarded as too low and the industry, including the Indian partners, was in favour of raising the limit to 49 per cent. The UPA government, which came into power in 2004, made several attempts to raise the foreign equity limit, but could not get support from the BJP and the Left. Ironically, it was the NDA government under Prime Minister Narendra Modi that was able to make the change in 2016. This example illustrates how reforms requiring legislative changes can become hostage to political posturing, but it also shows that parties which opposed the reforms when in opposition can end up supporting them when in power.
It is often said that the slow pace of reforms in India is due to the conscious choice of gradualism as a strategy. Gradualism has indeed been a preferred strategy, but it is not clear whether gradualism is the best description to apply to the Indian reform strategy. Logically, gradualism should mean giving a clear indication of where we want to get, but only stretching the transition over a longer time period to give people more time to adjust, or to build a broader consensus. However, this approach implies that the time period and the pace of transition should be clearly indicated at the start of the process so that people begin to adjust accordingly.4 India’s reforms have not been gradualist in this sense. Instead, they have often consisted of giving a broad direction, but without specifying a time path for the transition. Progress is then made in the broad direction outlined, with movement occurring as and when it is politically convenient. This is not so much ‘gradualism’ as ‘opportunism’. It can work under some circumstances, but it doesn’t make the case for reform sufficiently strongly to win public support. It also leaves investors confused on the reform signals, which means investments made on the assumption that the reforms will be carried through can prove infructuous.
Looking ahead, it is clear that the nature of democratic politics will continue to affect the pace of reforms. Democracy is not a consensual form of government: it is inherently an adversarial form, in which it is the business of the opposition to oppose. This creates less of a problem when the government commands a strong majority and political opposition can be managed through negotiation and compromise, especially when the underlying issue is one on which there is a broad base of consensus. The recent successful passage of a constitutional amendment to facilitate the introduction of a Goods and Services Tax (GST), which is a major step towards modernizing India’s indirect tax system, is a good example of how party positions that appear intractably opposed can be reconciled on issues where there is a broad base of public support. However, not all the reforms that are needed enjoy the broad base of support that the GST did.
The lesson to be learnt from the experience thus far is that much greater effort is needed to build public support on key elements of the reform agenda. This is especially necessary in the absence of a crisis when there is a real danger of complacency setting in. For example, we seem to be doing well at present, with growth above 7 per cent, but we are nowhere near achieving the objective of transiting to 8 to 10 per cent growth, which is necessary to fulfil the growing aspirations of the people. We will certainly not be able to make this transition unless economic reforms are accelerated, and to do this, it is important to make a clear case for acceleration, which often means having to face unpleasant truths and taking on vested interests.
One can easily understand why politicians favour reforms by stealth, because it suggests that one can achieve what one wants without disturbing the hornet’s nest of vested interests. However, this is unlikely to succeed in an active participatory democracy like India, where all interests have ample opportunity to have their say. It can work briefly in crisis situations, but in the end, those who want change have to build sufficient consensus for change. This is why the best we have been able to do is to build a strong consensus for weak reforms. To transform that into a strong consensus for strong reforms is the real challenge.
II. Assessing the Impact of Reforms
We now turn to an assessment of the reforms in terms of outcomes. The Twelfth Plan, which covered the period 2011–12 to 2016–17, had a subtitle that presented a tripolar objective: ‘Towards faster, more inclusive and sustainable growth’. This section presents a brief assessment of performance in each of these three areas.
Impact of Reforms on Growth
Since the rethinking on economic policy in the 1980s was motivated by the realization that India’s growth performance did not compare well with East and South East Asian countries, it is appropriate to begin with an assessment of the impact of the reforms on growth. Table 1 summarizes the growth rate in different sub-periods, treating 1991–92, which was the year of the crisis when growth dipped to 1.4 per cent, separately. Growth rates are presented for India and also for comparator countries or country groups for the period after 1980 from the IMF’s World Economic Outlook database.
Table 1: Growth Rates of GDP Pre- and Post-1991 (per cent per year)
  
*The growth rates in this row are from the national accounts that relate to the fiscal year 1 April to 31 March. All other rows show growth rates for the calendar year from the IMF WEO database. Thus, the growth rates based on national accounts data for 1980 to 1990 are for the period 1980–81 to 1990–91, and so on.
The following are the main points relating to India’s growth experience pre- and post-reforms, which emerges from the table.
(i) The growth rate of the economy in the three decades prior to the 1980s averaged only 3.5 per cent per year. It was a little higher in the first two decades and deteriorated to 2.9 per cent in the 1970s. This is the background in which policy rethinking of the 1980s took place.
(ii) The growth rate in the 1980s improved to 5.6 per cent, reflecting the positive impact of the incremental reforms undertaken in that decade, mainly in the second half. However, some of this growth was fed by an expanding fiscal deficit in the later years of the decade, which laid the foundations for the balance-of-payments crisis in 1991. The growth rate of 5.6 per cent recorded in the 1980s was, therefore, not sustainable.
(iii) In the first five years of the post-crisis period, i.e., 1992–93 to 1996–97, the economy grew at 6.5 per cent, which was significantly better than in the 1980s. It slowed down to 5.4 per cent in the next six years, 1997–98 to 2002–03, possibly reflecting the impact of the East Asian crisis, which led to a tightening of monetary policy in 1998 and also contributed to some worsening in the investment climate. This was also a period when economic reforms had slowed down, which may have had some effect on private investment intentions. Nevertheless, the average growth rate in the first ten years of the post-reforms period was around 6 per cent, about half a percentage point higher than in the 1980s.
(iv) The story of India’s growth in the 1990s compared to the 1980s and its relationship to reforms has been the subject of interesting debate in literature. Bradford de Long first pointed in 2001 out that despite the hype around the reforms of 1991, the growth rate in the 1990s was not much different from the 1980s, when there was very little by way of reforms and only a more ‘business friendly’ approach in operating the control system. On this basis, he argued that perhaps this business-friendly approach, and not reforms, was what mattered the most. In 2004 Dani Rodrik and Arvind Subramaniam came to the same conclusion, but went further to argue that perhaps the external liberalization undertaken in the 1991 reforms had been given undue importance by many analysts because of the importance ascribed to external liberalization in the Washington Consensus. In their view, it was the business-friendly approach of the government that mattered much more than external liberalization. I have argued in Ahluwalia (2016) that the Rodrik–Subramaniam proposition that external liberalization was not important is questionable for four different reasons. First, as noted above, the 5.6 per cent growth in the 1980s was in part fuelled by an excessively expansionary fiscal policy and was, therefore, not sustainable. Second, retaining a system of discretionary control but operating it in a business-friendly manner is not the best way of building a strong private sector. In fact, it poses a serious risk of degenerating into cronyism. Third, opening the economy in the early 1990s was critical for the long-term health of the economy. We would not have seen the explosion in IT services and software development if external liberalization had not occurred. Finally, the gradualist nature of the reforms meant that many of the changes were implemented only over time and, therefore, their full impact was probably felt only after the 1990s. The rapid growth experienced after 2003 is perhaps due to these lags working their way through the system.
(v) The thirteen-year period (2003–04 to 2015–16), which shows an average growth rate of 7.8 per cent, can be viewed as a vindication of the economic reforms. This period too can be divided into the first five years—2003–04 to 2007–08—before the financial crisis, when the economy grew at 8.7 per cent, and the next eight years—2008–09 to 2015–16—when it averaged only 7.2 per cent. The slower growth in the second period was partly a reflection of a global downswing and partly the emergence of domestic constraints, widely described as ‘policy paralysis’ in the last two years of UPA II, ending May 2014. The issue of whether the UPA government could have dealt better with the domestic constraints is a legitimate subject for study, but is beyond the scope of this paper. The point to emphasize for the present is that the average of 7.8 per cent growth for the entire thirteen-year period is an impressive demonstration of the impact of reforms on India’s growth performance.
It is relevant at this stage to ask whether the high growth experienced by India in recent years was due to policy or simply to the buoyant state of the world economy during most of the 2000s. Table 1 shows the comparative picture of India’s performance relative to China and other relevant groupings using the IMF’s World Economic Outlook data. The following conclusions emerge from Table 1: (a) India’s growth performance was poorer than China’s through most of the period, though the differential between the two narrowed in the later periods as China’s growth slowed down. In 2015–16, India’s growth, at 7.3 per cent, exceeded China’s at 6.9 per cent; (b) India’s growth performance was poorer than the ASEAN five in the 1980s, and also in the earlier years of the 1990s up until the ASEAN crisis, but it was much better than the ASEAN five after 1997–98; (c) India’s growth performance has been consistently better than Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa; and (d) India’s performance is also better than all EMDE countries excluding India and China in all the sub-periods.
Based on this, it is reasonable to conclude that India’s growth performance in the post-reforms period has been commendable. It certainly belies the fears of the many critics who, when the reforms were first introduced, predicted that they would have a disastrous effect on the economy and that the opening up would kill domestic industry. On the contrary, the economy has done well, better than in the past and also better than all other groups other than China.
Impact on External Vulnerability
The reforms were much criticized on the grounds that import liberalization would make us vulnerable to balance-of-payments crises, necessitating repeated recourse to the IMF, with a consequential subordination of national policies to the diktat of the IMF. These fears have also proved baseless, and India has not needed the IMF since the 1991 crisis.
India did experience external stress in the years after the Eurozone crisis when the current-account deficit increased to 4 per cent of GDP in 2011–12, thanks to a sharp increase in oil prices and a domestic fiscal policy that was excessively expansionary. The current-account deficit widened further to 4.7 per cent of GDP in 2012–13, much of it due to sharp increases in gold imports, which played the role of speculative capital outflows anticipating a depreciation. The ‘taper tantrum’ in April 2013 created uncertainty, putting pressure on the rupee, which depreciated from $1=Rs 54.4 in April 2013 to $1=Rs 63.2 in August, a depreciation of 16 per cent in four months.
Fortunately, timely corrective steps helped stabilize the situation without any need for the IMF. These steps included firm assurances of the following kind: action to reduce the fiscal deficit by P. Chidambaram, who had returned to the finance ministry in the second half of 2012; action to limit gold imports, which were playing a role similar to capital outflows; and unconventional action by the Reserve Bank of India in supporting Indian banks obtaining forward cover for dollar deposits from NRIs. The flexible exchange rate introduced by the reforms also helped by avoiding the need to defend an increasingly unrealistic exchange rate. The fact that reserves were built up in good times paid rich dividends in the form of a sizable cushion of reserves of over $320 billion, which helped to stabilize expectations. It is worth noting that although the current-account deficit in 2012–13 was much larger as a percentage of GDP than in the crisis year of 1990, the situation was managed without recourse to the IMF.
Has Growth Been Inclusive?
While the growth performance has been indisputably impressive, the record on inclusiveness is mixed. The Indian debate on inclusiveness has traditionally focused on poverty reduction, and experience in this dimension has been good, as documented below. But the Twelfth Plan had identified many different measures that were also relevant, including the growth of employment opportunities, the provision of essential public services to the poor, interregional inequality, and inequality across households. Much more needs to be done in these areas.
Trends in poverty reduction based on the Tendulkar Committee poverty line applied to the NSS consumer surveys are presented in Table 2.
Table 2: Percentage of the Population and Absolute Number in Poverty (Tendulkar Committee Poverty Line)
	Poverty Ratio 
(Percentage of the Population)	Absolute Number of Poor 
(Millions)
1993–94	45.3	403.7
2004–05	37.2	407.1
2011–12	21.9	269.3
In the eleven-year period immediately following the reforms, from 1993–94 to 2004–05, the percentage of the population in poverty declined significantly. However, the total population had increased in this period, and the absolute numbers in poverty actually increased marginally. This is basically similar to the pattern observed in earlier estimates of poverty based on the pre-Tendulkar poverty line, not reported above because the poverty lines are not comparable. The situation changed dramatically in the later period from 2004–05 to 2011–12. The percentage of the population in poverty declined much more sharply than earlier, and for the first time, there was also a sharp reduction in the absolute numbers below the poverty line—from 407 million in 2004–05 to 269 million in 2011–12.
These data refute the somewhat pessimistic assessments offered by many sceptics that growth has not benefited the poor.5 The scale of poverty remains very large, but there is little doubt that the rapid growth witnessed in recent years has reduced the scale of the problem. It is useful to consider the different mechanisms that may have been at work. Three possible mechanisms suggest themselves.
(i) First, there is the pure growth effect. GDP growth in the second period was much faster, with GDP growing at 8.5 per cent per year compared to 6.2 per cent in the first period. If we look at growth in per capita GDP, which is actually more relevant for poverty reduction, the proportional difference is more dramatic. Per capita GDP grew at 6.8 per cent per year in the second period, compared to only 4.4 per cent per year in the first period. Faster growth in per capita income would imply that for any given degree of ‘trickle down’ built into the growth process, we would expect a faster reduction of poverty
(ii) The ‘quality of growth’ is also important in determining the extent of the trickle-down. Some growth processes, e.g. those dependent primarily on mineral exploitation, do not lead to a wide spread of benefits, whereas growth processes that involve faster growth in agricultural GDP are much more likely to do so. As it happened, agriculture grew much faster in the second period, at 4.2 per cent per year, compared to only 2.7 per cent in the first sub-period, and this must have contributed to a greater decline in poverty.
(iii) Finally, the second period also saw an intensification of anti-poverty schemes, especially the rural employment guarantee programme plus various schemes to support rural livelihoods. Anti-poverty schemes represent what may be called a ‘direct attack’ on poverty, independent of the more general effect of aggregate growth and even sectoral growth.
All three factors enumerated above are relevant, but advocates of poverty reduction tend to focus exclusively on direct programmes of poverty reduction, dismissing (i) and (ii) above as mere trickle-down approaches. Not enough research has been done quantifying the contribution of each factor in any specific period, or in a particular state. This is a particularly valuable area for future research, especially focusing on the relative effectiveness of these three factors in the different states.
Employment creation is another dimension of inclusiveness and one that is much discussed globally. Complaints about ‘jobless growth’ are commonly heard in many industrialized countries, and similar complaints can be heard in India too. However, it is important to recognize that there are some special features of the problem in India. Open unemployment rate is not a good indicator of the scale of the problem. The unemployment rate in India varies from a low of around 3 per cent of the labour force, to a high of 7 per cent, depending on the particular definition of employment used, but the important point is that whichever measure of employment we use, the rate of unemployment does not show a significant increase over time. For example, the Usual Principal and Subsidiary Status (UPSS) measure shows unemployment of 3.17 per cent in 2004–05, falling marginally to 3.14 per cent in 2011–12. The reason why open unemployment is not a good measure of performance in this area is that in a developing country, where incomes are generally low and there is no social security, people are too poor or vulnerable to remain openly unemployed. They therefore take whatever job is available, even if the remuneration it yields is very low. In effect, many of those who are counted as employed in the statistics are actually underemployed.
The problem lies not in the lack of total employment opportunities generated, but in the quality of the employment. In 2016, Santosh Mehrotra reports that in 2004–05, total employment was estimated at 459.1 million, with almost 82 per cent in the unorganized sector and only 18 per cent in the organized sector. Furthermore, of those in the organized sector, only about 46 per cent were in formal employment with social-security protection, while the other 54 per cent were ‘informally’ employed, without full benefits. This latter category includes casual daily labour and contract workers. By 2011–12, the total employment had increased to 474.3 million, an increase of only 3.3 per cent over seven years. This looks very low, but the labour force had also expanded by 3.1 per cent in this period, reflecting a large increase in school intake as a result of the drive to increase schooling. The rate of unemployment, therefore, actually fell.6 Total employment in the organized sector increased by 75 per cent from 58.2 million to 101.6 million, increasing the share of the organized sector to 21.4 per cent. However, as much as 84 per cent of the increase in employment in the organized sector consisted of informal hiring so that the share of informal employment in the organized sector increased from 54 per cent in 2004–05 to 67 per cent.
The critical employment challenge in the years ahead is how to encourage sufficient growth in formal employment in the organized sector. Mehrotra estimates that such employment increased by only 6.8 million in the seven-year period of 2004–05 and 2011–12, or less than one million per year. Against this, the labour force is expected to increase by about 7 to 8 million per year, which could be higher if the presently very low female-participation rate increases. Most of the new entrants are better educated and have high aspirations for good-quality jobs in the organized sector, with some degree of social security. Although one should expect that many of them would be absorbed in well-paid self-employment, even if half the increase, or say, about 3.5 million, look for formal employment, that is much larger than the estimated addition of 1 million jobs per year in formal employment in the recent past.
It is important to recognize that there is no inconsistency between a very good performance in poverty reduction and a poor performance in providing good-quality employment. A decline in poverty only requires an increase in incomes in agriculture accruing to self-employed small farmers and higher wages for casual labour in both agriculture and construction, the latter being a sector that can readily draw unskilled labour from rural areas. While expanding employment in these areas are positive developments, they are of little interest to the better-educated youth entering the labour force, who are no longer looking only for low-quality employment opportunities that will only raise them slightly above the poverty level. They are looking for absorption in regular employment in the organized sector, a dimension in which performance thus far has been very poor.
The expectations of the younger and better-educated new entrants to the labour force can only be met through faster growth, especially in relatively labour-intensive manufacturing, which requires relatively low levels of skill. The organized sector needs to expand more rapidly than the unorganized sector, and with employers in the organized sector being willing to expand formal employment. This calls for action on several fronts. Since the most labour-intensive firms are small or middle-sized, it is necessary to create an economic environment where these firms flourish and expand. The objective should not be to simply keep a very large number of very small-scale operations in business, but to encourage new small firms to enter and grow to a level where they can provide good-quality employment. Their growth will displace the less successful small firms in the same area, but this structural churn has to be accepted.
The areas where action is needed to achieve these objectives are well known. They include:
(i) creation of improved infrastructure, especially availability of good-quality power and improved transport and logistics;
(ii) improving the ease of doing business with both state government and central government agencies;
(iii) removing biases against the growth of the organized sector vis-à-vis the unorganized sector (plugging tax avoidance would help greatly in this context and the introduction of the GST will help);
(iv) introducing sufficient flexibility in labour market policies, including flexibility in laying off labour, to encourage firms to expand their formal labour force;
(v) and finally, removing distortions in the land market that have become a major constraint according to Ghani et al. Action is being taken in some of these areas, but it is not clear that it is sufficient. Relatively little progress has been made thus far in addressing labour and land market constraints.
The third dimension of inclusiveness where India’s performance is also disappointing is in the provision of essential public services such as health, education, clean drinking water and sanitation. This failure has been extensively discussed in literature, see in particular Amartya Sen’s and Jean Drèze’s An Uncertain Glory: India and its Contradictions (2015). The good news is that the situation is improving in both these areas, but the bad news is that it is not improving as fast as one would have hoped for. There has been a substantial increase in the coverage of primary education, which is now being expanded into secondary education, but problems of quality remain serious, especially in rural areas. Unless the poor have access to good-quality education, the expansion of enrolment will not help much and will certainly not level the playing field to provide equal opportunity.
Progress in the delivery of public health services is also inadequate. All the health indicators are improving, but in many respects, especially relating to sanitation and child malnutrition, India’s performance is poorer than that of other low-income countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. It is also poorer than neighbouring Bangladesh as Sen and Drèze have shown.
Faster progress in both education and health is not only critical for improving the welfare of the bulk of the population, it is also critical for economic expansion. No country has been able to achieve rapid growth of GDP for an extended period without raising the levels of education and health of the bulk of the population to reasonable levels. China had achieved this before it entered its high-growth phase. India is probably just getting to where China was twenty years ago. The solution calls for action in two different dimensions. First, it certainly requires much larger government expenditure in the provision of these services. Expenditure by both the Centre and the states on education and health needs to be increased by at least 3 percentage points of GDP over the next five years. This will have to be fitted within the fiscal constraints of both the central government and the state governments, which in practice requires prioritization within the expenditure budget, including phasing out subsidies to those who don’t really need them, combined with mobilization of additional budgetary revenues. Second, it calls for substantial improvements in state capacity to ensure that increased expenditure actually delivers results. The delivery of these services is the responsibility of state and local government functionaries, and therefore, most of the improvement in delivery systems has to be orchestrated at that level.
Has the Growth Been Sustainable?
Finally, it is relevant to ask whether the faster growth generated in the post-reforms period has been sustainable. This is perhaps the most disappointing aspect of the performance. Rapid growth is bound to generate environmental stress, which takes many forms. It includes:
(i) erosion of forest cover because of felling of trees;
(ii) pollution of natural waterbodies such as lakes and rivers because of dumping of untreated sewage, industrial effluents and run-off of fertilizers and pesticides;
(iii) local air pollution due to burning of fossil fuels and other unsupervised incineration of municipal waste, along with crop residues, and construction activity without precautions to prevent spread of particulate matter;
(iv) traffic congestion in cities due to inadequate transport planning and absence of public transport;
(v) increase in soil salinity from excessive watering and fertilization;
(vi) accumulation of municipal solid waste in urban areas and unscientific methods of waste disposal;
(vii) and finally, emissions of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere because of burning of fossil fuels, leading to global warming.
Of the seven negative consequences listed above, the last is a global problem, and it can be argued that an optimal effort can only be made with global cooperation and some agreed system of burden sharing. We have seen some progress in this area recently, but not enough, and the new US administration has signalled some rethinking which adds to the uncertainty. However, the other six are essentially local problems where the benefits of action taken to control negative effects are all internal to the economy. There is no excuse for not taking action to control these negative effects. The need to do so has been known for quite some time, but it has not been translated into effective policy formulation and implementation. The result is that whether we look at forest cover, water quality or air quality, the situation is actually deteriorating.
In the case of forest cover, which is critical for groundwater recharge and to protect against soil erosion, the present level of 23 per cent by area is very far below the target of 33 per cent, and although there has been a marginal upturn in the area under forest, the quality of the cover has deteriorated. In the case of water, all our major rivers are heavily polluted and, in most stretches, are well below bathing quality. This is because most of the sewage generated in the cities flows untreated into these rivers. The total sewage treatment capacity in India is only about 30 per cent of the total urban sewage generated and even that is not fully utilized. Industrial effluents are also not adequately treated before being dumped into natural waterbodies. The inability (or more likely, unwillingness) to impose strict control on small-scale units, threatening them with closure if they don’t comply, is an important explanatory factor. Air quality in Indian cities has deteriorated alarmingly, and the WHO recently declared Delhi as the city with the worst air quality in the world. The World Bank has estimated that the cost of high air pollution in India is as much as 8.5 per cent of GDP.
In short, we have some way to go before we can arrest the ongoing deterioration in most environment-related indicators, and it will obviously be an even longer haul before we can actually reverse the deteriorating trend. The good news is that most of this can be tackled if there is determination and political will. Containing these undesirable consequences of unsustainable growth calls for high-quality design of regulation, optimal structures of pricing and penalty to discourage polluting activity, combined with firm enforcement. Unfortunately, the regulations that exist in these areas are poorly designed and even more poorly enforced. Enforcement is largely in the realm of state governments, and vested interests are strongly entrenched. Better regulation will inevitably involve higher costs, but this is only giving teeth to the principle that the polluter must pay. In practice, the costs would be borne largely by the higher-income population, and in the absence of effective action, the cost of pollution is borne disproportionately by the poor.
Fortunately, this is an area where public consciousness has begun to increase and the shortcomings are increasingly being pointed out by the media. The judiciary has also been more active in intervening in environmental issues. While judicial intervention is no substitute for effective regulation and enforcement, it helps to raise consciousness and provides an area of focus for NGOs to complain. It remains to be seen whether all this can be translated into determined action by both the central and state governments.
To summarize, there is much that has been achieved in the twenty-five years since the reforms began, but as the old problems were solved, new ones have surfaced, and solutions to these need new initiatives that will have to be as far-reaching as the original reforms were.
